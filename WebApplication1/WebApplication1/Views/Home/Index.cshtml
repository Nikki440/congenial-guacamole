	<p>After a long day at the zoo, Bob realized the most congenial guacamole he’d ever tasted was actually being guarded by a very judgmental llama. Bob had never been particularly adventurous, but when his friend Sarah dragged him to the zoo’s “Annual Exotic Foods Festival,” he figured it was worth a try. After all, how often do you get to taste international cuisine while watching penguins waddle around? It started off normally enough — a few empanadas here, some yakitori there — but then Bob stumbled upon a modest-looking booth tucked between the reptile house and the petting zoo. A hand-painted sign read: “Guacamole of the Gods.” Intrigued (and more than a little hungry), Bob approached the booth, where a cheerful woman handed him a small bowl of guacamole with a basket of freshly fried tortilla chips.

		From the very first bite, Bob knew this was no ordinary guacamole. It was creamy yet chunky, with the perfect balance of lime and spice. “This guacamole… it’s congenial,” he muttered to himself, though he wasn’t exactly sure why that word popped into his head. It just felt right — like the guacamole somehow understood him on a personal level.

		But as he reached for another chip, Bob sensed he was being watched. Slowly, he turned his head and locked eyes with a llama standing just a few feet away behind a low fence. The llama’s deep brown eyes were narrowed suspiciously, and its long neck swayed as it assessed Bob with unsettling focus.

		Bob chuckled nervously and took another bite. The llama’s eyes narrowed further.

		“Relax, it’s just guacamole,” Bob said aloud, though the tension in the air suggested otherwise.

		Suddenly, the llama let out a guttural noise and leapt over the fence with surprising agility. Bob barely had time to react before the llama’s head shot down toward the guacamole. Bob yanked the bowl away just in time.

		“Hey! This is mine!” he shouted, backing away.

		The llama stomped its foot, snorted indignantly, and lunged again. Bob spun around and took off, weaving through the festival crowds as the llama pursued him with a surprising level of athleticism.

		“Someone stop this llama!” Bob yelled, clutching the bowl to his chest like it was the last precious artifact of a lost civilization.

		A zookeeper finally intercepted the llama just as Bob dove behind the cotton candy stand. Breathless and covered in a light dusting of tortilla crumbs, Bob sat on the ground and stared at the guacamole.

		“Totally worth it,” he said, scooping up another bite.

		From that day forward, Bob swore the guacamole tasted even better — perhaps because he knew it had been battle-tested by one of nature’s most discerning critics.It started off normally enough — a few empanadas here, some yakitori there — but then Bob stumbled upon a modest-looking booth tucked between the reptile house and the petting zoo.
